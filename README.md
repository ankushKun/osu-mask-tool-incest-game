# OSU + MASKING TOOL RYTHM GAME

I am making a game which mixes the concept of photoshop masking tool with osu! rhythm game.

A video plays in the background, and random shapes appear on the screen on top of the video according to the beats, for a short time and then disappears.

The player then has to to draw the same mask shape on the video after it disappears, from memory. the more accurate the mask drawn the more points gained.

There will be a reverse timer progress bar at bottom within which the player has to draw the mask to pass
